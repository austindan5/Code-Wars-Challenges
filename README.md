I am dedicated to completing at least one coding challenge a day so that I can constantly work on my problem solving skills



How It's Made:
Tech used: JavaScript

These challenges allow me to seen solutions in different ways and to challenge myself by coding each day. I love how it feels when I get the correct solution but it is also wonderful to learn when I can't solve it.

Lessons Learned:

There is never one way to solve a problem. Depending on the type of issue there is and the person, there are many ways to work towards a solution. I love practicing my problem solving abilities that I have gained from practical experience. With coding challenges and my freelance work, I love emersing myself in coding to build something new and innovative.
